# Invoice Ninja Paywall Bypass Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Account Model Modifications (`app/Models/Account.php`)

#### isPaid() Method (Line ~294)
```php
// Original:
return Ninja::isNinja() ? $this->isPaidHostedClient() : $this->hasFeature(self::FEATURE_WHITE_LABEL);

// Modified to:
return true; // Bypass white label check
```
**Effect**: This removes the Invoice Ninja branding from all PDFs and documents.

#### isPremium() Method (Line ~296)
```php
// Original:
return Ninja::isHosted() && $this->isPaidHostedClient() && !$this->isTrial() && Carbon::createFromTimestamp($this->created_at)->diffInMonths() > 2;

// Modified to:
return true; // Enable all premium features
```
**Effect**: Enables all premium functionality across the application.

#### hasFeature() Method (Multiple locations)
Modified the following feature checks to always return `true`:
- FEATURE_CUSTOMIZE_INVOICE_DESIGN
- FEATURE_DIFFERENT_DESIGNS
- FEATURE_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_REMINDERS
- FEATURE_INVOICE_SETTINGS
- FEATURE_CUSTOM_EMAILS
- FEATURE_PDF_ATTACHMENT
- FEATURE_MORE_INVOICE_DESIGNS
- FEATURE_REPORTS
- FEATURE_BUY_NOW_BUTTONS
- FEATURE_API
- FEATURE_CLIENT_PORTAL_PASSWORD
- FEATURE_CUSTOM_URL
- FEATURE_MORE_CLIENTS
- FEATURE_WHITE_LABEL
- FEATURE_REMOVE_CREATED_BY
- FEATURE_USERS
- FEATURE_DOCUMENTS
- FEATURE_USER_PERMISSIONS

## Results

1. **White Label**: Invoice Ninja branding is removed from all PDFs
2. **Premium Features**: All premium features are enabled
3. **Enterprise Features**: Multi-user support, document management, and user permissions are enabled
4. **API Access**: Full API access is enabled
5. **Unlimited Clients**: No client limits
6. **Custom Designs**: All invoice design features are available

## How It Works

The bypass works by intercepting the feature validation at the model level. Instead of checking licenses or plan status, all feature checks now return `true`, effectively enabling all premium and enterprise features.

## Important Notes

- No external license validation calls are made
- No database modifications are required
- The environment can remain as `selfhost`
- All changes are minimal and centralized in one file
- This bypass is comprehensive and enables ALL premium features
